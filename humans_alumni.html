          <h1> Mizzou Alumni Association honors 12 alumni, faculty </h1>
          <h2> BY WENDY WRITER </h2> </br>
          <p>  The Mizzou Alumni Association recognized 12 faculty and alumni Friday at MU’s Reynolds Alumni Center.

The 48th annual Faculty-Alumni Awards Ceremony honored those who have advanced the arts, sciences and humanities during their careers.

The Distinguished Service Award went to José Gutiérrez, a graduate of the MU Trulaske College of Business. Gutiérrez came to the United States from Madrid with limited English proficiency. He now works at AT&T as senior executive vice president of executive operations and has held other executive positions at the telecommunications company.  </p>

          <p> Homecoming is all about bringing Missouri alumni back to town to celebrate with the current crop of students. Here are some favorite memories of past Homecoming events as recalled by alumni. </p>

          <h1> Alumni support still positive </h1> 
          <h2> BY FRED PHOTO </h2> </br>
          <p> A day after the NCAA announced its sanctions against the Missouri men's basketball program, the prevailing mood Thursday at the university was relief that the findings weren't worse.

Although the NCAA found MU had committed numerous infractions, it did not find evidence to support some of the most serious charges, including academic dishonesty and cash payment of players.

"I think it's fair to characterize our team's evaluation as one of guarded relief," Michael Devaney, MU faculty council president, said. "Of the 11 infractions contested, the committee ruled against the university in only two cases." </p>
