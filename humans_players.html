          <h1> Five observations from Missouri's loss to No. 2 Georgia </h1>
          <h2> BY JENNY JOURNALIST </h2> </br>
          <p> Missouri suffered its first loss of the season Saturday, falling to the No. 2 Georgia Bulldogs 43-29 at Memorial Stadium. The Tigers hung around until the fourth quarter, but poor execution and missed opportunities sealed Missouri’s fate.
Quarterback Drew Lock was held in check, and Georgia’s Jake Fromm led a formidable offense that plummeted any of the Tigers’ comeback hopes with touchdown throws of 61 and 54 yards in the second half. </p>

          <h1> Lock ready to put struggles behind him after rough three-game stretch </h1>
          <h2> BY KELLY TIGER </h2> </br>
          <p> Drew Lock looked tired.

As he answered questions in the bowels of Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium following another loss and another underwhelming individual performance Saturday night, one thing was clear: The Tigers’ three-game run against No. 2 Georgia, South Carolina and No. 1 Alabama — and the challenges that came with it — has taken a lot out of him.

Missouri’s 21-year-old starting quarterback is burnt.

          <h1> Missouri vs. Auburn - Game Summary </h1>
          <h2> BY TRUMAN TELLER </h2> </br>
          <p>  Kerryon Johnson rushed for a career-high five touchdowns and No. 15 Auburn ended its recent offensive struggles in a 51-14 victory over Missouri on Saturday night.

Johnson, who had missed the previous two games with a hamstring injury, finished with 48 yards rushing on 18 carries and fell one short of Carnell Williams' school record of six rushing touchdowns in a game. </p>
